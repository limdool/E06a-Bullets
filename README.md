# E06a-Bullets
For this assignment, I had to edit some lines so a narwhal could attack penguins by firing bullets. The score will increase when penguins get defeated. The narwhal can move from left to right and right to left by moving a mouse left and right. Bullets can be fired by clicking the left button of a mouse.
